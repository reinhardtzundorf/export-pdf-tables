11,The goal of this final year project was to develop an auction module for online gaming ser-
12,vice as well as a management system for this and other future models. It was also decided
13,that the development should follow a specific set of practices so that it would be easier to
14,extend the system in the future.

16,A large number of different web technologies and tools were used as part of the process
17,"which are all described in this thesis. For front end development, common technologies"
18,"like HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used. In addition, JavaScript’s jQuery library and"
19,"Twitter’s Bootstrap framework were utilized. Bootstrap, for example, enables bringing to-"
20,gether all the other front end techniques and provides many components for a faster de-
21,"velopment process. In the back end, the main tool was a PHP framework called Laravel"
22,"which utilizes a development architecture style known as MVC. Also, MySQL databases"
23,were an essential part of the project. The main ideas of all these technologies are ex-
24,plained in detail where necessary.

26,"As a result of this project, a content management system was created and an auction"
27,module was implemented as a part of this system. This system has been built on a pro-
28,found foundation to support multiple web sites and future implementations. The auction
29,module works as a fully functional prototype but will still be thoroughly tested in the future
30,before its final release. The management system on the other hand is already in use and it
31,will be utilized with all the future modules. Laravel web application framework was very
32,"useful in this, as it turned out to be highly efficient and provided a steady environment for"
33,the development process.
