0,"development, is designing and developing websites and web applications using tech-"
1,nologies that run on the web platform. The purpose of these sites and applications is to
2,"work as interfaces, also known as Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), for the users. The"
3,"standard front end technologies include HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and"
4,"JavaScript. In addition, DOM (Document Object Model) is also often counted in these"
5,technologies as it has become an intrinsic part of web development. Quite often one
6,can hear an example where front end technologies are described in relation to a per-
7,"son where HTML is the skeleton, CSS the skin and JavaScript all the actions or func-"
8,tions that a person can perform. Here DOM could be compared to basic human anato-
9,my. All these techniques are constantly evolving so a good developer should always be
10,following what are the newest standards and additions. The main objectives of front
11,"end development are to provide users with interfaces that are easy to use, fast to load"
12,and hold relevant content. On top of this the developer should take care that sites are
13,responsive for different screen sizes and resolutions plus compatible with various
14,"browsers, operating systems and devices. [3.]"

16,2.1 Document Object Model
17,
18,The starting point for front end development is the Document Object Model which is a
19,tree-like way of describing how a website or web application is structured and how all
20,"the different pieces, or objects with their own specific identities, are related to one an-"
21,other. It was originally meant to allow making scripts and programs portable for the web
22,browsers but has since then evolved to become an API (Application Programming In-
23,"terface) for the HTML and XML (Extensible Markup Language), meaning that it gives"
24,tools to access and manipulate these types of documents. HTML and XML are similar
25,ways of describing data in documents and with DOM it is possible to modify their struc-
26,"ture and content, or even create new documents from the scratch. DOM has been"
